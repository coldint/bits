## Abstract

More attention can be drawn to BITs by having a Discord bot post a link to new
BITs submitted. Bringing BITs in the realm of Discord makes it easier for
regular users to discover pending BITs and perhaps cast votes on them using
well-known Discord responses.

## Motivation

After the first BITs were proposed, nothing happened. No response, no
conversation, just nothing. The proposer now has to bring their BIT under the
attention of the community. Meanwhile, the community is running into issues
that these BITs address. This disconnect can be cured by bringing BITs (that
start out as PRs) to Discord, using a bot like the one already posting
bittensor and subtensor PRs to dedicated Church of Rao channels.

## Specification

Copy&paste the setup of the GitHub bot currently posting to github-bittensor
and github-subtensor in The Church of Rao Discord server.

## Rationale

See above. No alternate design was considered.

## Backwards Compatibility

N/A

## Reference Implementation (Optional)

See github-bittensor and github-subtensor in The Church of Rao Discord server.

## Security Considerations

As this would be a duplication of the feature already implemented in The Church
of Rao, no security issues are expected.
